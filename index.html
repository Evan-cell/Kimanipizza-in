            <h6>The homemade pizza dough is produced in-house
                 daily and is another reason why the pizza at
                  Pizza Inn always tastes better. The Twisty 
                  Bread, the signature Wingz and the delicious
                   Double Meal are additional value-for-money
                    options that keep our satisfied customers
                     coming back time after time. These are the
                      meals that have made our Terrific Tuesday
                       everyoneâ€™s favourite day of the week. When
                        entertaining, a Hawaiian, a Regina, or a
                         Peri Peri Chicken pizza from Pizza Inn is
                          the obvious and perfect option to please 
                          crowds of all ages.  </h6>
